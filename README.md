# Password Generator

The Password Generator creates a password, comprised of random characters in a random order.

The password length is specified by the user. The character sets that make up the password ae likewise specified by the user. In the current version, the length is limited to between 8 and 128 characters, and the character sets are limited to those found on US keyboards: numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and special characters. (However, tweaking the code to change the length limit, or to include or omit other character sets (such as non-Arabic numerals, or non-Roman-alphabet letters) would be trivial.)

In the current version, the Password Generator does not force the user to include more than a single character set. However, the generated password is guaranteed to include at least one character from any character set selected.
